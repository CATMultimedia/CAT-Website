			<p><strong>Greetings from Torreón, Mexico</strong></p>

			<p>The American School of Torreón (C.A.T.) is an accredited, private, independent day school serving the educational needs of the community of the Laguna Region known as the Comarca Lagunera. The Comarca Lagunera is the region where the two states of Durango and Coahuila meet and it includes the 3 cities of Lerdo, Gomez Palacio and Torreon. The school is located in Torreon.</p>

			<p>Established in 1954, C.A.T. is governed by a thirteen-member Board of Directors. </p>
			<p>The educational program includes a college preparatory curriculum taught mainly in English (some classes are in Spanish) that extends from Kinder to 12th grade and that results in the acquisition of an American High School diploma and the Mexican Bachillerato diploma for its graduates. The student body is 97% Mexican, 2% U.S. and 1% others. Both the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (S.A.C.S.) and the Secretary of Education of Mexico accredit C.A.T.</p>

			<p>The school's mission statement proclaims its commitment to life long learning, helping students achieve academic excellence, develop responsibility, and become contributing citizens of the global community. We at C.A.T. have much to be grateful for: a modern teaching campus, spacious physical education facilities, an exceptional faculty, a supportive parent community, and best of all a spirited and motivated student body. On behalf of the entire C.A.T. community, I take pleasure in welcoming you to our school community. As we say around here, mi casa es tu casa. Thank you for your interest! </p>

			<p>Makhlouf Ouyed<br />
			<em>General Director</em></p>
