			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>The American School of Torreón was founded in 1950 by a group of enthusiastic people who wished to offer to the Laguna region a first class, bicultural and bilingual education.</p>
				<p>Their primary goal was not only to teach the English language correctly but also to offer students a complete North American cultural experience.</p>
				<p>Students would not only learn to speak and write in English, they would be totally immersed in a program providing a comprehensive understanding of United States educational programming and culture.</p>
				<p>It was an idea&mdash;a challenge.</p>
				<p>It was the beginning of the American School of Torreón.</p>
			<h2>Our Beginning</h2>
				<p>In September of 1950 the American School of Torreón began operating with 38 students and 4 teachers in a house provided by Peñoles, a local mining industry.</p>
				<p>Four years later, the school had grown and changed its location to 20 Escobedo Avenue.  By then, the number of students had increased to 250. Mr. Clinton A. Luckett and Mrs. Joe Athon founded The American School of Torreon with the support of a board of directors, a visionary and progressive group of locals and expats.</p>
				<p>The first general director was Dr. Paul H. Jensen.  The American School, also known as CAT (Colegio Americano de Torreon) was founded as a non-profit, non-denominational, co-educational institution. Since its beginning, the school has been accredited by S.E.P and since 1954 by the Southern Association of Colleges and School (SACS), a U.S. accrediting agency. </p>
				<p>To this date the school maintains accreditation with both SEP and SACS.</p>

			<h2>Los Viñedos Campus</h2>
				<p>In 1998 the American School of Torreón received a donation of approximately 6.5 acres located in Los Viñedos from Efrain Lopez Gurza, a CAT alumnus.</p>
				<p>The campus and a new high school/middle school in Los Viñedos was inaugurated in 2001. The new facilities included 26 classrooms, seven science labs, three computer labs, a library, music and art rooms, a fully equipped gymnasium, and an administrative office complex.</p>
				<p>In 2004, CAT began construction of a second complex to house kindergarten and elementary students. A second gymnasium, cafeteria, and a second library were also added.</p>
				<p>These additions were finished in June of 2006 and marked the end of the Torreón Jardín campus era.</p>
			<h2>Our Present</h2>
				<p>Now, with more than 1,300 students from prekindergarten to high school, the American School of Torreón still believes firmly in its vision and mission.</p>
				<p>Thanks to the dedicated support of our students and their parents, of the many parents who form the Parents' Association, members of the Board of Directors, Directors General, principals, teachers, office and maintenance staff, The American School of Torreón became what it is today: an institution with 63 years of academic excellence, committed to training learners capable of successfully assuming their role in a global environment through a demanding college preparatory curriculum.</p>
