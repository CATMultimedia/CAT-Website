			<p>At the Music Department we are engaged  with our students integral development and we consider Music Education as one of the disciplines that provides, to whom practice it, valuable abilities and skills with a high formative value.</p>
			<p>The Children’s Orchestra is part of the KIII curriculum and every year the students are tested and selected to be part of it.</p>
			<p>The main purpose is to develop music skills as playing rhythmic patterns that follow a melody, to follow the director’s indications and to work as a team on the instrumental ensemble.</p>
			<p>At Elementary, our students have a wide music program in which they learn: music theory, reading notes, sight singing, traditional harmony, performing music pieces, composition.</p>
			<h2>CAT Ensembles</h2>

			<p>Musicians  know that learning music has a positive impact on other areas of a student’s  life too.  We have witnessed how it helps students to improve their self-discipline, dexterity, coordination, self-esteem, thinking skills and listening skills. In addition to this, recent scientific research has found that music develops both sides of the brain which stimulates a child’s academic, emotional, physical and spiritual response.</p>
			<p>Music ensembles in particular train children not only to play music but also to have a sense of commitment, to work with others harmoniously and to deal with self-expression in a constructive way. It is a wonderful experience that will provide students with lasting benefits.</p>
